This codebase is a Django-based SQL workbench and data analysis platform called Datasage. Here's a comprehensive summary:
Core Purpose
Datasage is a web-based SQL notebook application that allows users to connect to databases, write and execute SQL queries, visualize data, and generate knowledge graphs from database schemas.
Architecture Overview
Backend (Django)

Framework: Django 5.2 with Python
Database: MySQL/MariaDB with PyMySQL adapter
Authentication: Custom user model + Django Allauth for OAuth (Google)
Key Apps: core (main functionality), mcp_agent (mentioned but not detailed)

Frontend

UI Framework: Vanilla JavaScript with some Vue.js components
Code Editor: CodeMirror for SQL editing
Visualizations: Plotly.js for charts/dashboards
Knowledge Graphs: Vis.js network library
Styling: Custom CSS with modern design patterns

Key Features
1. Database Connectivity

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Snowflake connections
Encrypted credential storage using Fernet encryption
Connection validation and management
File uploads (CSV, Excel) for data import

2. SQL Notebook Interface

Cell-based execution: Similar to Jupyter notebooks but for SQL
Real-time editing: CodeMirror-powered SQL editor with syntax highlighting
Result display: Formatted tables with execution timing
Auto-save: Automatic saving of notebook content
Export capabilities: Export query results to dashboard for visualization

3. Database Schema Explorer

Interactive sidebar: Browse database schemas, tables, and columns
Table metadata: Show row counts, column types, and keys
Search functionality: Find tables and columns quickly
Expandable tree view: Hierarchical navigation of database structure

4. Knowledge Graph Generation

Schema visualization: Automatic generation of database schema graphs
Relationship detection: Identifies potential foreign key relationships
Interactive exploration: Click nodes to see details, search functionality
Multiple layouts: Hierarchical, force-directed, and circular layouts
Color coding: Different colors for different data types

5. Data Visualization Dashboard

Chart types: Bar, line, scatter, pie charts, and histograms
Dynamic data: Import query results directly from notebook cells
Interactive controls: Column selection, chart customization
Real-time generation: Instant chart creation from SQL results

6. User Management

Custom user model: Extended Django user with additional fields
OAuth integration: Google sign-in with account merging
Role-based access: Admin and normal user profiles
Session management: Secure authentication with remember-me option

Data Models
Core Models

User: Custom user model with OAuth support
Thread: User conversation/analysis sessions
DatabaseConnection: Encrypted database credentials
SQLNotebook: Container for SQL queries and analysis
SQLCell: Individual executable SQL statements
KnowledgeGraph: Stored schema visualizations

Security Features

Encryption: Sensitive data (passwords, connection strings) encrypted at rest
CSRF Protection: All forms protected against cross-site request forgery
User isolation: All data scoped to authenticated users
Secure sessions: Configurable session expiration

Technical Highlights
Database Operations

Query execution: Safe SQL execution with result formatting
Schema introspection: Dynamic database schema discovery
Connection pooling: Efficient database connection management
Error handling: Comprehensive error catching and user feedback

Frontend Architecture

Modular JavaScript: Separated concerns (notebook, dashboard, schema explorer)
Global registry: Cross-script communication system
Event-driven: Responsive UI with proper event handling
Progressive enhancement: Works without JavaScript for basic functions

API Design

RESTful endpoints: Clean API for notebook operations
JSON responses: Structured API responses
Real-time updates: Dynamic content loading without page refresh
File handling: Support for file uploads and processing

Development Features

Management commands: Custom Django commands for deployment
Static file handling: Optimized CSS/JS serving
Environment configuration: Docker-ready with environment variables
Database migrations: Proper Django migration system

Use Cases

Data Analysts: Interactive SQL querying with visualization
Database Administrators: Schema exploration and documentation
Business Users: Self-service data analysis with guided interface
Teams: Collaborative SQL notebook sharing and documentation

This is a sophisticated, production-ready data analysis platform that combines the power of SQL with modern web technologies to create an intuitive, feature-rich database workbench.
